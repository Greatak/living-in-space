title: Uranus System

Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar system and the smallest of the giant planets. This gives it the lowest escape velocity at 21.3 km/s. This makes it potentialy the cheapest source of deuterium and helium-3 in the system. Uranus is unique in having a relatively undifferentiated atmosphere, with heavier molecules lingering in the upper layers, making deuterium and helium-3 more common than the surfaces of the other giant planets.

## Energy
Uranus is poor in sources of energy, but high in sources of fuel. Sunlight is only 0.2% of what it is at Earth and the only fissile material is deep within the core of the planet. Even in that regard, Uranus has a smaller rocky core than Neptune. The mantle is relatively cold as well, not transferring much heat to the surface and windspeeds are relatively low (200m/s) and limited banding makes it hard to harness that wind. But Uranus is rich in deuterium, helium-3 and methane, all valuable fuels for an interplanetary economy.

## Moons
The moon system of Uranus is fairly small relative to other giant planets, both in total mass and number. The inner moons are in a state of continuous turmoil as they interact with one another and the Uranus' rings, but they are generally too small for meaningful geothermal power to be harvested through these interactions. The major moons are in stable orbits with very little tidal heating, but were once hot enough to differentiate. This leaves their rocky cores relatively inaccessible under a thick layer of ice.
