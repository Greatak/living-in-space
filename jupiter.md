Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar system though mainly it is of interest because of its large moons. Most are typical of moons beyond the frost line, but Europa is a popular candidate for life in its liquid water mantle.

Settling the Jovian system would give a great opportunity to study the moons there as well as provide a ready source of volatiles the Inner System lacks. While solar power is impractical this far away and icy moons tend to be poor in fissile material, Jupiter itself is a powerhouse of a planet. The powerful magnetic field and radiation belts can be tapped for power and many of its moons are geologically active due to tidal forces.

Challenges around Jupiter are considerable. Three of the largest moons, Io, Europa and Ganymede, are within Jupiter's intense radiation belts where shielding is essential. Jupiter itself is also an enormous gravity well, making it difficult to leave, especially from lower orbits. It is also located far enough from the sun that solar power is impractical.
