Lagrange points are places of gravitational equilibrium between a set of bodies. Of most interest are those that exist between a planet and its moons. Space elevators on Luna are impossible due to how slowly it rotates, but a tether could reach to the L1 and L2 points of the Earth-Moon system. Of particular interest is EML-2, where objects can leave the station with very nearly escape velocity of Earth, bound for deep space with very little push.
