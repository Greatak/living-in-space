Venus' thick atmosphere makes it Hell on the surface, but being so thick, it is relatively easy to float on it. Large balloons could hold up living spaces powered by sunlight and wind. Earth's atmosphere is less dense than Venus' so any interior pressurized space would add to the buoyancy. The balloons could even be kept at a height where the outside pressure is the same as Earth, making it comfortable to be outside, though protection from the corrosive air would still be necessary.
