An orbital ring is a little bit like a maglev train, but in orbit. The 'track' component is a band of conductive material in orbit, it loops around the world at an appropriate speed so it doesn't fall down. Hanging onto that are the 'trains' which are magnetically levitated so they don't need to touch the track and can then move at whatever speed desired. This can either form stationary platforms above the world (a much cheaper alternative to a space elevator) or they could actually be trains and move around in orbit or even accelerate payloads to proper orbital velocity to send them out into space.
