Perhaps one of the simplest ways to settle any world is to just build something and fill it with air. Whether this comes in the form of a large dome for some wide open spaces or just a series of buildings and tunnels, keeping a space enclosed allows for tight control of the ecosystem to keep everyone with enough air to survive. These are practical anywhere with enough surface gravity to survive or even less for temporary stays.
