A special kind of underground structure, lava tubes can be found on many worlds that are or were geologically active. Non-porous basaltic rock forms the walls and while not completely airtight, gives a better starting point than other sorts of underground structures. These make excellent sites for initial settlement where available as you can avoid much of the costs of building the structure.
