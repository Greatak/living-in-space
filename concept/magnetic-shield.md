Atmospheres are in a delicate balance between gravity holding them around a world and their own energy flinging them off into space. Closer to the sun, this is even more of a problem as the solar wind can add a great deal of energy to an atmosphere and slowly blow it off into space. The solar wind is composed mostly of charged particles, which can be deflected with a magnetic field as is the case for Earth. But when a planet lacks such a defense, it can be artificially created with large magnets on the surface or in orbital satellites that cast a magnetopause around the planet. In either case, the power consumption is enormous, but essential for long-term terraforming.
