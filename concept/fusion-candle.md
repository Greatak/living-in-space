Efficient fusion reactors would completely change the nature of energy costs. The fuel is so phenomenally abundant and it is so ridiculously powerful that it becomes practical to just keep a structure flying above the surface. Such a structure could fly over a gas giant, consuming the air and using it to propel itself upwards. Enough of these could even be used as gravity tethers to move a massive object.
