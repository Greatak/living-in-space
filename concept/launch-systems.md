Rockets are a fine way to leave the surface of any world, but their reliance on reaction mass can make them a hassle as a world starts to experience more traffic or just when launch costs are too burdensome for the local economy. Multi-stage rockets, mass drivers providing first-stage acceleration and ground-based lasers powering the rocket are all ways to reduce launch costs by relying on energy from the ground. Langstrom loops and orbital rings allow for acceleration to be done mostly outside of the atmosphere, though they can also be used on airless worlds when the surface is ill-suited for long tracks. All the way to sky hooks and space elevators to impart force on spacecraft sufficient to just release them already at orbital speeds. Each approach has its own mixture of challenges so it's likely that a range of options will be available.
