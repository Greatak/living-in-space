Some worlds rotate exceedingly slowly relative to the Sun, so slow that even a walking pace is sufficient to keep the Sun from setting. Trains could be constructed to take advantage of this, keeping solar panels always exposed to sunlight or keeping sensitive industrial complexes always in shadow. Especially in the Inner System, temperatures fluctuate wildly on the surface from day to night, so keeping residential trains permanently on the terminator would allow them to maintain a pleasant temperature.
