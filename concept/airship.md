A variety of aerostat designs exist, but all are based fundamentally on buoyant force. On Earth, this can be achieved with helium. On Venus, a normal breathing mix will do. But on a giant planet, the atmosphere at the nominal surface is far too thin to float much of anything. Deeper into the planet, however, the density increases and airships can maintain buoyancy if they can survive the pressure. In these circumstances, however, the airship becomes more like a submarine with an incredibly strong hull to withstand the pressure.
