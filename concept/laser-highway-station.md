The void between stars is vast and dark, but not entirely empty. Moving between stars is an expensive proposition if you're bound by the rocket equation, but riding on a laser makes tremendous speeds possible and substantially cheaper. Doing so is dangerous though, as the risks of hitting debris are catastrophic. Luckily the same lasers that propell the craft can also be used to keep the highways clear of hazards. They could even be used as a line of defense against hostile invaders or observation posts to see who is coming and going.
