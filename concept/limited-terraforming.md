Not every world needs the whole surface to be habitable. Some are too small to hold onto an atmosphere for very long, or lack a magnetic field to protect the air from solar wind. In these cases, the world will continue to lose air that must be replaced. Instead of losing air across the whole surface of the world, large walls could be constructed to hold air only over a smaller part of the surface. This would still lose air, but at a much reduced rate, and only over the parts of the world you actually care to inhabit, making the terraforming process substantially cheaper, and allowing for growth over time as technology improves.
