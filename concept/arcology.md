An ever popular theme in scifi, arcologies are little more than space stations but on the ground. The internal ecosystem need not be completely self-sufficient, but the economy of such a settlement generally is. A mixture of residential, commerical and industrial spaces all woven into one large structure makes for a fairly efficient use of space, though perhaps uncomfortable to most folks. These are not likely to be terribly popular unless Earth sees tremendous population growth, or life in space acclimatizes people to closed ecosystems and dense living.
