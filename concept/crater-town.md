Craters come in a wide range of sizes and give convenient places to begin constructing domes. The impacts that produced the crater can also leave mineral deposits to make them attractive places to settle. In some cases, craters near poles can provide cold traps where an otherwise warm world is never exposed to sunlight, making it an attractive place to settle on a scorching world like Mercury, or just because water ice can collect in dark craters on Luna. Such craters can also have rims which are always exposed to sunlight, providing cheap energy to the dark basin.
