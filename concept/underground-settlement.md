Once you figure out how to keep breathing, two major threats emerge to life in space: heat and radiation. There are a plethora of strategies to deal with both, but among the simplest is to build underground. The material above you will shield from radiation and you can use the mass of the world you've burrowed into to manage the temperature. It gets easier, the less gravity there is, since you need less structure to hold up the material above the habitat.
