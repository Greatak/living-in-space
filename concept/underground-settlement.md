Life on the surface of a world poses a number of risks: cosmic radiation, micrometeorite impacts and difficult thermal management to name a few. Fortunately for the low-tech space settler, these challenges can also be addressed by building underground. Whether accomplished by backfilling an excavaged trench, burrowing directly into the crust or sealing off a lava tube, the material above the habitat will mitigate most of the immediate threats from space and provide some level of protection against leaking air as well. The habitats themselves will take their cues from conventional space habitat design: well-sealed to keep in the air and a carefully managed life support system to keep it breatheable.
