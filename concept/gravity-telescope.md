Not necessarily a specific kind of settlement, a gravity telescope can take many forms or even be completely automated. By necessity, however, they must be located far from the local star and planets, beyond the focal point of the gravitational lenses of the system. Star lenses have more powerful magnification, while planet lenses are somewhat easier to orient towards a target. In either case though, they allow for very powerful telescope capable of even imaging large-scale surface details on Earth-sized planets lightyears away.
