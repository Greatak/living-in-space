Some amount of gravity is probably always going to be necessary for human survival. Exactly how much is still an open question, but the cheapest way to get it in space is by spinning. If you build a reasonably large space station and set it spinning, the centrifugal force will feel an awful lot like gravity and the lack of friction in space will keep it spinning for a very, very long time. They can come in all shapes and sizes but make living anywhere more tolerable.
