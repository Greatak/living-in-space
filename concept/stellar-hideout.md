With sufficient radiators, almost any temperature can be survived. Even stars can be settled if some reason for doing so exists. Secret bases would be almost impossible to detect close to, or even under the surface of a star. The enormous radiator fin necessary to keep it from melting would be washed out by starlight for all but the closest of inspections. It would be an incredibly challenging thing to do, but not completely beyond the realm of possibility.
