Orbital rings make a fantastic foundation for space infrastructure, but once the first equatorial ring is constructed, they can be built at any inclination and remain stationary over the surface. For a sufficiently advanced civilization, this could be repeated over and over until the orbital rings completely enclose the world, making a new surface suspended above the first. This is a Birch World. What is inside the shell could be anything. A planet, a ball of gas, even a star or black hole. Such a surface can be as large as you can find a sufficient gravity well to build it around and could certainly hold an atmosphere and be built to resemble any environment.
