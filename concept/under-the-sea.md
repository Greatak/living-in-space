Something like 71% of the Earth is covered with oceans that are generally regarded as useless for settlement. Settling the sea floor is a substantial challenge, but there are vast resources that have gone untouched there. It would take structures capable of withstanding tremendous pressures and careful pressurization protocols, not unlike life in space. Trialling such settlements on Earth would provide a relatively safe environment to prepare for life on Venus or under the ices of the Outer System.
