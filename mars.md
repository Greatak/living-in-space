Quite possibly the world with the most settlement interest, at least since the Venera program, Mars has a long history of proposed missions. Ever popular in the search for extraterrestrial life as well as planetary science, missions run the gambit from temporary expeditions to full-on terraforming.

Settling Mars is almost just like settling Luna, except it's larger. A rather thin atmosphere allows for aerobraking to reduce the cost to reach Mars and allows for winds that could provide power. Evidence of water in the past could mean that Mars has mineral veins to be efficiently mined. It is of particular interest for settlement primarily because it is the most similar world in the Solar system to Earth.

Though somewhat similar, the differences are quite substantial. The thin atmosphere is as bad as a vacuum as far as the human body is concerned, the temperatures are generally low even during the day and radiation is not filtered to any meaningful degree. This means that Mars' surface would have to be settled similar to an airless world with pressurized habitats and radiation shielding.
