Earth should need no introduction as the cradle of humanity and wellspring of life in the Solar system. It is exceedingly likely that it will remain home to the majority of humans for the foreseeable future and this is unlikely to result in a dystopian sprawl that consumes the planet. But in the event modern population projections prove to underestimate, it may be worth considering how Earth could be made to support more people.

The largest asset by far is the existence of a robust biosphere. Some minerals, such as phosphorous, are only practical to find when they are bio-concentrated. Earth also has the advantage of life support equipment that can sustain itself indefinitely and maintain an oxygen-rich atmosphere, even in remote places. Humans presently only inhabit a small fraction of the surface, barely touching the extreme places that are infinitely more liveable than space.
