## General Settlement Concepts

While every world has a unique set of circumstances and advantages, some types of settlements are feasible anywhere with enough gravity to form a Hill sphere. All of these are forms of orbital infrastructure and can be placed on any orbit practical. In places where orbital infrastructure is of particular interest, they will have been mentioned already.
