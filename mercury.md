Mercury is a place of extremes. So close to the Sun, it is nearly tidally locked, with a day lasting two complete orbits. Such long days leave the surface facing the sun a scorching 700K and a frigid 100K on the night side. In a few craters near the poles that are always in shadow, it gets colder still. But in such an environment, energy is abundant and resources plentiful, making Mercury a fine place to settle and build things. That is, if the transportation costs don't scare you off.

## Physical Characteristics

Mercury's has a fairly typical differentiated structure. A silicate-rich crust extends a couple hundred kilometers before giving way to a somewhat fluid mantle. Below this is Mercury's massive molten iron core which composes over 55% of the volume. Though the interior of the planet is still quite hot through tidal flexing, it is insufficient to power any tectonic activity on the surface.

The surface geography is somewhat similar to Luna, dominated by craters with ancient lava-filled basins formed when the surface was more active. Some time after the last of the major impacts, Mercury cooled and contracted to form ridges across the surface which soar to hundreds of meters high in some cases. Though geologically inert today, volcanism shaped much of the surface, with evidence of pyroclastic flows and collapsed lava tubes scattered across the surface. Space weathering wears down all of this terrain, amplified by Mercury's magnetosphere, including in some cases bombarding regions of the surface in flux transfer events where the full solar wind is briefly channeled to the surface.

Along with diverse surface features, the composition of the surface also varies considerably. The surface is mostly composed of silicon and oxygen as with any terrestrial planet, but other volatiles are relatively plentiful on Mercury's surface as well. Potassium is quite abundant near the north pole and sulfur and chlorine is rich in some impact basins. The polar regions are much colder than the equator, allowing the persistence of these volatile materials. However, Mercury's magnetic field shields the northern hemisphere more strongly than the southern, allowing the north to build up volatiles over time and leaving the southern hemisphere richer in heavier materials. Craters very close to either pole are permanently in shadow and can form cold traps below 100K where even water ice persists.

## Energy

Perhaps moreso than any other place in the Solar system, Mercury is overflowing with energy, especially before the advent of a fusion economy. It has the most abundant energy budget with an average solar irradiance of 9082 W/m^2, over 6.6 times that of Earth. Besides this, it also experiences the widest day/night temperature gradient in the Solar system of around 800K. At something like 30-meter depths, the temperature of the rock will average out to the mean temperature, allowing heat pumps to draw power from 400K temperature differences in the ground as well. This gradient is far less steep at the poles, which have much lower average temperatures because there is no atmosphere to redirect light or hold in heat. Mercury's magnetic field is about 1% the strength of Earth's and could be a source of energy as well, at least for relatively small orbital applications. However, sunlight is far more plentiful and easier to obtain and will dominate Mercury's energy budget even into the fusion age.

## Resources

Mercury's crust is relatively rich in metals compared to other terrestrial worlds, but the lack of water at any point in its history makes the likelihood of concentrated ore veins extremely unlikely. Geological processes produce some concentration in various parts of the surface with iron, aluminum and magnesium ores being particularly plentiful. These compounds are widely distributed, however, necessitating massive excavation and energy-intensive separation. Similar to Outer System worlds, mineral concentrations are likely to be found in impact ejecta rather than from geological processes. In addition to this, Mercury has a decent supply of volatiles, constantly being outgassed from the intense heat and radiation of the day side. Due to the uneven magnetic field, volatiles are continually lost from the southern hemisphere and deposited on the northern hemisphere, concentrating phosphorous and sulfur in the northern latitudes. The cold traps at both poles contain substantial reserves of water ice as well.
