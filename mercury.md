The closest planet to the Sun is very brightly illuminated with nearly seven times the solar energy available at Earth. Even without practical fusion reactors, Mercury is well-suited to high-energy activities because of this abundant energy, no atmosphere to block the light and no wind to damage or obscure solar panels. Mercury is also relatively metal-rich for a terrestrial planet, making mining potentially more lucrative than other worlds.

Settlement of Mercury is likely to be industrial in nature, utilizing it for resource production or to operate energy-intensive processes. Of particular interest is the possiblity of providing material for mirrors and water to terraform Venus. Mercury is unlikely to ever be a candidate for terraforming, but has nearly identical surface gravity to Mars, so long-term settlement is certainly possible if it proves feasible to settle Mars.

Challenges to settling Mercury aren't terribly different than settling any other world without an atmosphere. All habitats will need to be well-sealed and sheilded from radiation. In particular, thermal management is important on Mercury thanks to its proximity to the Sun, but there is at least a cold night to balance the temperature.
