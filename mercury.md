Mercury is a place of extremes. So close to the Sun, it is nearly tidally locked, with a day lasting two complete orbits. Such long days leave the surface facing the sun a scorching 700K and a frigid 100K on the night side. In a few craters near the poles that are always in shadow, it gets colder still to below 80K. But in such an environment, energy is abundant and resources plentiful, making Mercury a fine place to settle and build things. That is, if the transportation costs don't scare you off.

## Physical Characteristics

Mercury has a fairly typical differentiated structure. A silicate-rich crust extends a couple hundred kilometers before giving way to a somewhat fluid mantle. Below this is Mercury's massive molten iron core which composes over 55% of the volume. Though the interior of the planet is still quite hot through tidal flexing, it is insufficient to power any tectonic activity on the surface.

The surface geography is somewhat similar to Luna, dominated by craters with ancient lava-filled basins formed when the surface was more active. Some time after the last of the major impacts, Mercury cooled and contracted to form ridges across the surface which soar to hundreds of meters high in some cases. Though geologically inert today, volcanism shaped much of the surface, with evidence of pyroclastic flows and collapsed lava tubes scattered across the surface. Space weathering wears down all of this terrain, amplified by Mercury's magnetosphere, including in some cases bombarding regions of the surface in flux transfer events where the full solar wind is briefly channeled to the surface.

Along with diverse surface features, the composition of the surface also varies considerably. The surface is mostly composed of silicon and oxygen as with any terrestrial planet, but other volatiles are relatively plentiful on Mercury's surface as well. Potassium is quite abundant near the north pole and sulfur and chlorine is rich in some impact basins. The polar regions are much colder than the equator, allowing the persistence of these volatile materials. However, Mercury's magnetic field shields the northern hemisphere more strongly than the southern, allowing the north to build up volatiles over time and leaving the southern hemisphere richer in heavier materials. Craters very close to either pole are permanently in shadow and can form cold traps below 100K where even water ice persists.

## Energy

Perhaps moreso than any other place in the Solar system, Mercury is overflowing with energy, especially before the advent of a fusion economy. It has the most abundant energy budget with an average solar irradiance of 9082 W/m<sup>2</sup>, over 6.6 times that of Earth. Besides this, it also experiences the widest day/night temperature gradient in the Solar system of around 800K. At something like 30-meter depths, the temperature of the rock will average out to the mean temperature, allowing heat pumps to draw power from 400K temperature differences in the ground as well. This gradient is far less steep at the poles, which have much lower average temperatures because there is no atmosphere to redirect light or hold in heat. Mercury's magnetic field is about 1% the strength of Earth's and could be a source of energy as well, at least for relatively small orbital applications. However, sunlight is far more plentiful and easier to obtain and will dominate Mercury's energy budget even into the fusion age.

## Resources

Mercury's crust is relatively rich in metals compared to other terrestrial worlds, but the lack of water at any point in its history makes the likelihood of concentrated ore veins extremely unlikely. Geological processes produce some concentration in various parts of the surface with iron, aluminum and magnesium ores being particularly plentiful. These compounds are widely distributed, however, necessitating massive excavation and energy-intensive separation. Similar to Outer System worlds, mineral concentrations are likely to be found in impact ejecta rather than from geological processes. In addition to this, Mercury has a decent supply of volatiles, constantly being outgassed from the intense heat and radiation of the day side. Due to the uneven magnetic field, volatiles are continually lost from the southern hemisphere and deposited on the northern hemisphere, concentrating phosphorous and sulfur in the northern latitudes. The cold traps at both poles contain substantial reserves of water ice as well.

## Challenges

The initial concern for any attempts to settle, or even visit, Mercury is the cost to get there. An optimistic delta-V cost of 8.65 km/s is just to orbit Mercury from Earth, higher than any other Inner System destination. This is further complicated by the lack of atmosphere so capturing into an orbit must be powered. On the plus side, however, once in orbit, it's fairly easy to land or take off with less than a third of the launch budget as Earth. Beyond this concern, life on the surface would not differ substantially from the challenges of any world without an atmosphere, no protection from radiation or micrometeorites.

## Settling Mercury

Mercury's primary advantage is access to substantial energy regardless of technological development. With minimal infrastructure investment, it is possible to survive on the surface or more accurately, just under it. A comfort band around each hemisphere exists with 295K temperatures and burying a habitat under a shallow covering of regolith shields it from radiation and extreme swings in temperature. As technology permits greater thermal management and exploitation of Mercury's resources, the band of survivability expands and includes orbital space. Whether this ultimately results in a populated Mercury or the dismantling of the planet or even just a few isolated settlments operating energy-intensive facilities will depend on the role Mercury can ultimately play in the solar economy.

### Solar Farms

On the surface or in orbit, solar energy is abundant and easily harnessed. Constructing sophisticated photovoltaic panels is likely beyond an early settlement's industrial capacity, but Mercury has plenty of metals with which to produce mirrors. These can be used to concentrate sunlight onto sturdy, imported solar panels, or used to power heat engines, or use the heat directly. Even into the fusion economy, solar power on Mercury is competitive for high-energy applications such as particle accelerators and refining. Once sufficient infrastructure exists near the Sun, it can even be beamed further out into the system for a variety of purposes from powering solar sails to lighting solar panels in the Outer System. This energy could also be useful to give inbound spacecraft a way to slow down and make the planet more accessible.

### Underground Settlements

The intense temperature swings of Mercury can be mitigated with only a few meters of regolith. Near the equator, this depth increases to a few dozen meters, but is still not a substantial barrier to development and would shield a habitat from the harshest effects of Mercury's climate. Purpose-built bunkers or retrofitted lava tubes would work equally well and provide the foothold necessary to begin exploiting Mercury's extensive resources and form the origin of a planet-wide transportation network.

Sulfur deposits in Mercury's northern comfort band can be mixed with regolith to produce a form of concrete to seal any structures and oxygen can be baked out of the rock while at the same time providing raw materials for other purposes. Mercury also has lava tubes accessible from the basins of some craters, which house concentrations of various resources. The reduced gravity makes constructing extensive subterranean complexes much easier as the regolith above does not exert as much pressure on the structure.

### Polar Cold Trap Craters

Water availability is a critical feature for settlement sites. While it is very common throughout the Solar system, successful settlements require so much it is rarely practical to import it. SOme polar craters on Mercury maintain temperatures below 100K because they are permanently in shadow and have gradually built up water ice; nearly as much ice exists on Mercury as the Antarctic ice cap on Earth. Building settlements in these craters can be an essential source of water as well as for heat-sensitive processes.

### Sunrise Trains

Though the intense sunlight available on Mercury is immensely valuable, it can make living on the surface difficult to settle. Solar panels experience long periods in darkness on the night side and habitats get roasted during the long days. Mercury rotates at about 10.8 km/h at the equator, making mobile structures that chase their ideal temperature and lighting conditions quite feasible, either as trains or independent vehicles. Solar farms can keep themselves under constant sunlight, data centers in constant cold on the nightside and residential habitats can chase the sunrise.

### Globus Cassus

Mercury's low gravity may ultimately prove to make it unviable for long-term settlement. But the high metal content and plentiful energy make it a wonderful industrial center that could turn the raw material of the planet into an enormous construct to live on instead. It could be built into a large number of conventional space habitats, or one large shell where Mercury used to be. The interior of this surface could be inhabited, spun up to the necessary level of gravity and openings carefully sized to keep the sunlight only warming it up to a reasonable temperature. The outside of the shell covered in solar collectors and radiators to keep the whole structure a practical temperature.
