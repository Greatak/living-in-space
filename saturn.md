Saturn is a fairly mundane gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with a metallic core. Deuterium and helium-3 can be found in abundance in the clouds. Deeper into the planet are heavier metals as well, though accessing these requires more substantial extraction technology. Surrounding Saturn is a ring of water ice approximately the mass of Mimas (3x10^19 kg) in addition to a constellation of over 60 moons of various sizes. Most of these moons are made of water ice and rocky cores, but some are captured asteroids and all have been peppered with impacts over the ages. Saturn's system is somewhat more accessible than Jupiter, with almost half the escape velocity.

## Energy
Power generation is a substantial concern for Saturn. The sun shines about 1% as bright as it does on Earth and as with every world in the Outer System, fissile material is scarce. Saturn's upper layers regularly see windspeeds of over 400 m/s and the depths of Saturn approach 12,000K, radiating more energy than it recieves from the Sun. In either case, it would be tricky to extract energy from these sources, requiring enormous investment within the planet. More practically, Saturn's magnetosphere can be tapped for power and, if available, fusion fuels of all sorts are available in abundance.

## Moons
Saturn's moons generally share a similar structure. Their crust is composed mostly of water ice with impurities from impacts. Below this is a liquid water mantle, heated through tidal action with Saturn. This mantle is reasonably rich in ammonia as well as other volatiles. In most cases, this liquid mantle transitions to solid high-pressure ices before yeilding a silicate core. In general, these moons are not particularly rich in metals, requiring extraction from their cores or the occasional metal-rich impact crater. Beyond the orbit of Titan, however, are dozens of irregular moons which have a range of compositions.

### Titan
Titan is Saturn's largest moon by a comfortable margin and the only moon in the Solar system with a substantial atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen. It's surface hosts numerous hydrocarbon lakes which power a climate cycle where methane rains on a cycle of seasonal downpours to decades without rain depending on the estimates. Like all of Saturn's moons, Titan's surface is frigid (94 K) but with a thick atmosphere to convect, the cold is a much more potent threat.

### Enceladus
Enceladus is the smallest geologically-active body in the Solar system. It has a peculiar size just large enough to have a substantial rocky core, but just small enough that the liquid mantle reaches that core with no outer core of ice. This makes the moon a particularly interesting option for resource extraction as it is the easiest to access silicate mass in the Outer System. However, this interaction also makes it a possible candidate for life as undersea vents could power a biosphere responsible for the composition of gesyer plumes that periodically erupt from the surface.

## Settling Saturn
Saturn itself is a tricky site for settlement due to the lack of a surface to land on. A region of the atmosphere where the pressure is equal to Earth is sometimes called the surface, but it is not particularly dense. This makes buoyant craft impractical as well as lifting surfaces which would need to be enormous or moving incredibly fast. Saturn's gravity well is fairly substantial as well, requiring over 20 km/s to reach a low-orbit from the surface.
