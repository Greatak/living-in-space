Venus is often described as Earth's sister because of its similar size but in almost every other regard, it is utterly foreign. Atmospheric density at the surface is 92 times higher than Earth and the temperature exceeds 700K. Despite those differences, the composition of Venus is fairly similiar to Earth, with a surface likely rich in silicates.

Settling Venus is attractive for a few reasons. While it is unclear as of now whether gravity on Mars will be sufficient to avoid microgravity sickness, surface gravity on Venus is 90% that of Earth, which is almost certainly sufficient. The atmsophere is also rich in carbon and nitrogen, both essential elements for growing food. It is also somewhat closer than Mars, with more frequent transfer windows and slightly shorter trip durations. For scientific objectives, Venus also represents a different sort of environment than most places throughout the Solar system.

The challenges to settlement are enormous. Incredible air pressure, scorching temperatures, acidic clouds and gale force winds make it a substantial challenge. Venus also lacks a conventional magnetic field. Despite this, it makes a compelling target for terraforming if these can be overcome.
