Neptune is an ice giant with the strongest winds in the Solar system. A large liquid mantle of water, ammonia and other salts churns beneath the clouds to power a heat engine that drives nearly supersonic winds (600 m/s) with strong banding with latitude and altitude. This conductive mantle is also responsible for the world's complex magnetic field. As is typical with an ice giant, the upper atmosphere is relatively rich in methane and other hydrocarbons. Neptune has a system of planetary rings as well, including the Adams Ring, which is a series of arcs that share an orbit, prevented from forming a continuous ring by a shepherd moon. Neptune's modest moon system is composed of mostly small icy objects and a single large moon, Triton, with a much more substantial rocky core. 

## Energy
The Neptune system is particularly suited to Outer System power generation. Sunlight reaching the world is only 0.1% of that which reaches Earth and, as with every world in the Outer System, fissile material is scarce. However, Neptune's core is hot and the internal dynamics of its mantle bring a lot of energy to the surface and power a substantial magnetic field. While Neptune is somewhat denser than most gas giants, it is similarly rich in deuterium and helium-3 for fusion power. If aerial wind turbines are feasible, Neptune offers not only the strongest winds in the Solar system but some of the most persistent storm systems.

## Moons
Most of Neptune's moons are inert chunks of ice and all were disturbed considerably when Triton was captured. Of the seven regular moons, all but two are on unstable orbits that will one day destroy them as they fall into Neptune or break apart to form new rings. None of the moons besides Triton are particularly large. Even Proteus, the second largest, is only 420 km across.

### Triton
Neptune's largest moon is a captured Kuiper Belt object larger than Pluto. The surface is covered in a layer of solid nitrogen with a watery mantle below. Unlike the rest of Neptune's moons, the water eventually gives way to a rocky core that composes the majority of the mass. This core is massive enough that radioactive decay heats the mantle enough to convect and drive cryovolcanism on the surface and potentially even a subsurface ocean. Resources from the core might be the only way to acquire metals in the Neptune system without lifting material from the planet itself.

## Settling Neptune
Neptune has a 

### High-Pressure Airship
Though an airship has substantial problems in any giant planet, Neptune poses greater risks thanks to the even higher windspeeds. However, the structure of the atmosphere maintains a strong gradient with altitude. As a result, airships could use sails and tack between these altitude bands to maneuver through the atmosphere. They could even power these craft by harvesting wind energy from the end of long kites. Travel to and from these craft would be immensely expensive, though power could potentially be beamed to oribtal infrastructure.
