Earth's only natural satellite is a convenient and relatively safe place to begin settling space. Space stations take a lot of mass to construct and lifting it from Earth is an expensive process. In-situ resource utilization on Luna is a cheaper alternative, even if it's only to build space stations. Luna's composition is fairly similar to Earth's, though it likely lacks mineral veins since there is no liquid water.

Proximity to Earth means that complex manufacturing is close at hand. Specialized machinery and personnel on Earth can provide Luna with whatever settlers cannot make on hand. This makes it generally much safer to trial settlement technologies and shorter stays are feasible as there is no real need to wait for launch windows to reach Luna. There are also substantial water reserves at the poles and even evidence of phosphorous on the surface, giving it quite a few of the basic building blocks of life without needing to import them from Earth.

Settling Luna poses plenty of challenges however, as it does have substantial temperature swings as any airless world does and radiation is a substantial hazard, particularly if it is being used as a proving ground for settlement techniques.
